# Terraria Mod: Witchery
This is a work-in-progress Terraria mod centered around witchcraft and brewing. It introduces unique mechanics and items to enhance gameplay for those who love the mystical arts.

## Features
- Throwing Flasks: Use various brews, each with distinct and powerful effects.
- Witch-Focused Equipment: Accessories and armor designed to complement a witch's playstyle.
- One-Time Use Scrolls: Expensive but potent scrolls that can turn the tide in critical moments.   

Iâ€™m not very active on this project, but if development continues, stay tuned! Contributions and suggestions are always welcome and highly encouraged.
